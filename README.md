# Task Examples

[Task](https://taskfile.dev/) is a task runner / build tool that aims to be simpler and easier to use than, for example, GNU Make.

This repository contains examples of how to use Task as the common homogeneous standard (wrapper) to build, test and run 
your teams application locally regardless of which programming language, architecture or underlying build tool used.

The goal is to make it as painless as possible for a new developer, or a developer who does not work with the code-base daily, to get up and running.
